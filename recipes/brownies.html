    <h2>A recipe for easy yet delicious chocolate brownies</h2>
    <p>If you're ever thinking of baking something but think everything looks too difficult, or looks like it's going to take a lot of time? Then this is the recipe for you</p>
    <p>This is a recipe for gooey and decadent chocolate brownies that won't take all day to make</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>275g softened butter</li>
        <li>375g of caster sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>75g cocoa powder</li>
        <li>100g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>100g plain chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180c</li>
        <li>Cut a rectangle of non-stick baking parchment to fit the base and sides of a 30cm x 23cm x 4cm traybake or roasting tin. Grease the tin and then line it with the paper, pushing it neatly into the corners.</li>
        <li>Measure all the ingredients into a large bowl and mix with a hand-held electric mixer until evenly blended.</li>
        <li>Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping the sides of the bowl with a plastic spatula to remove all of it. Spread the mixture gently to the corners of the tin and level the surface with the back of the spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the brownies have a crusty top and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cover loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes if the mixture is browning too much.</li>
        <li>Allow the brownies to cool in the tin and then cut into 24 squares. Store in an airtight tin.</li>
    </ol>
